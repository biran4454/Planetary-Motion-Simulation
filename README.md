 Playing around with a more physically accurate model of particles.
 
Probably doesn't work. I probably messed up the code, the physics, the maths, or all three. But it's cool anyway, even if Processing is kind of the wrong place to do it in. Hmu if you're new here and you found it without me linking to it.
Have fun.
